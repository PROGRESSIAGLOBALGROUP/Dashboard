# ðŸ”§ FIX APPLIED: Clear Success Message - One-Time Display

## Problem
Message "âœ… Datos borrados exitosamente - Estado vacÃ­o" was appearing on **every page refresh** instead of only when deletion occurred.

## Root Cause
The `sessionStorage` flag (`CLEARED_FLAG`) was set during deletion but **never cleared** after the message displayed. On refresh, the condition triggered again, showing the message repeatedly.

## Solution
Added cleanup code to remove the `sessionStorage` flag **after** the success message fades out (5.3 seconds total).

## Files Modified
- `dashboard_enhanced.html` (root, line ~1060)
- `dist/dashboard_enhanced.html` (dist, line ~1060)

## Change
```javascript
// Added after message fades:
sessionStorage.removeItem(this.CLEARED_FLAG);
```

## How It Works
1. User deletes data â†’ flag set to `INTENTIONALLY_CLEARED_BY_USER`
2. Message displays for 5 seconds
3. After message fades â†’ flag removed from sessionStorage
4. Page refresh â†’ flag gone, no message appears
5. Next deletion â†’ cycle repeats

## Test Steps
1. Open dashboard with data
2. Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Clear All Data (confirm both dialogs)
3. âœ… Message appears for ~5 seconds
4. Wait for message to fully fade
5. Refresh page (F5)
6. âœ… NO message appears (dashboard shows empty silently)

## Scope
- Only affects the success message after data deletion
- Does not change any other functionality
- No impact on normal dashboard operation
