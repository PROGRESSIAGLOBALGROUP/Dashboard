  "description": "Add progress transition validation and confirmation popups to the Create Application modal form",
  "rationale": "Users should not be able to arbitrarily change progress without confirmation. When creating/editing applications, changing progress from 0â†’>0 should trigger 'Start' popup, >0â†’0 should trigger 'Reset' popup, and other transitions should be validated similar to the inline table editor.",
  "impact": "Create Application modal now enforces the same progress state machine as the inline table editor, ensuring consistent behavior and user confirmation for critical state changes.",
  "riskLevel": "Low",
  "changes": [
    "Added modalProgressState tracking variable initialized to { currentProgress: 0, previousStatus: 'TBS' } when modal opens",
    "Added listener on appProgressInput.change() that validates transitions using detectProgressTransition()",
    "When transition requires popup, calls showProgressPopup() with appropriate type (START/RESET/REOPEN/COMPLETION/UPDATE)",
    "On confirmation, updates appStatusInput based on transition type",
    "On cancellation, reverts the progress value to previous state"
  ],
  "validation": {
    "beforeExecute": "Modal allows setting progress without validation or status updates",
    "afterExecute": "Modal validates progress changes and shows popups when needed, updates status automatically"
  },
  "testing": {
    "manual": [
      "Open dashboard in browser (file://)",
      "Click 'Create New Application' button",
      "Set Progress % to 50 (from 0)",
      "Verify 'ðŸš€ Start Activity' popup appears",
      "Verify Status automatically changed to 'WIP'",
      "Cancel the popup",
      "Verify Progress reverts to 0 and Status reverts to 'TBS'",
      "Try again and confirm",
      "Verify app is created with Progress=50 and Status=WIP",
      "Test other transitions: 50â†’100 (COMPLETION), 100â†’50 (REOPEN), 50â†’0 (RESET)"
    ]
