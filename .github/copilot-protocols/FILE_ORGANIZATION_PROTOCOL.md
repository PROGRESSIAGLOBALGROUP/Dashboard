# 🤖 GitHub Copilot - File Organization Protocol

**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025  
**Scope**: Dashboard Enhanced Project

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. **NO UNSOLICITED DOCUMENTATION**
- ❌ NEVER create `.md` files unless explicitly requested by user
- ❌ NEVER generate "summary", "report", or "documentation" files automatically
- ❌ NEVER create files "for completeness" or "best practices" without explicit request
- ✅ ONLY create files when user specifically asks: "create a report", "document this", "generate summary"

### 2. **STRICT PATH COMPLIANCE**
- ✅ ALWAYS use the established directory structure
- ✅ ALWAYS place files in their semantically correct location
- ❌ NEVER create files in root directory unless they are core project files

### 3. **PURPOSE-DRIVEN CREATION**
- ✅ Every file must have a clear, specific purpose
- ✅ User must explicitly request the file creation
- ❌ No "nice to have" or "documentation completeness" files

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY

### Rule #1: ASK BEFORE CREATING DOCUMENTATION
```
❌ BAD: "I'll create a summary report of the changes..."
✅ GOOD: "Would you like me to create a summary report? If so, where should I place it?"
```

### Rule #2: NO AUTOMATIC REPORTING
```
❌ BAD: Auto-creating IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md after making changes
✅ GOOD: Only create documentation when user says "document this implementation"
```

### Rule #3: VALIDATE PATH BEFORE CREATION
```
✅ ALWAYS check: "Is this the correct path for this type of file?"
✅ ALWAYS use: Established directory structure above
❌ NEVER create: Files in wrong directories
```

### Rule #4: FILE PURPOSE VALIDATION
```
Before creating ANY file, ask:
1. Did user explicitly request this file?
2. Does this file serve a specific, immediate need?
3. Is this the correct location for this type of file?
4. Am I creating this just for "completeness"? (If yes, DON'T CREATE)
```

## 📋 FILE CREATION DECISION MATRIX

| File Type | User Must Say | Correct Location | Examples |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Code Files** | "Create/modify code" | `src/modules/`, `scripts/` | `.js`, `.css`, `.html` |
| **Documentation** | "Create documentation/report/summary" | `docs/[category]/` | `.md` files |
| **Tests** | "Create tests" | `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` | Test files |
| **Config** | "Create config" | Root or appropriate dir | `.json`, `.yml` |
| **Fixes** | "Create fix/solution" | `scripts/fixes/` | `.js` scripts |

---

## 🎯 PATH SELECTION GUIDE

### When User Requests Documentation:

**"Create a report about [feature]"** → `docs/reports/`
**"Document the implementation"** → `docs/implementations/`  
**"Create feature documentation"** → `docs/features/`
**"Document the fix"** → `docs/fixes/`
**"Create user guide"** → `docs/guides/`
**"Document technical specs"** → `docs/technical/`
**"Create process documentation"** → `docs/process/`

### When User Requests Code:

**"Create/modify functionality"** → `src/modules/`
**"Add styles"** → `src/styles/`
**"Create fix script"** → `scripts/fixes/`
**"Create build script"** → `scripts/build/`
**"Create test"** → `tests/[type]/`

---

## 🛡️ PREVENTION CHECKLIST

Before creating ANY file, verify:

- [ ] User explicitly requested this file
- [ ] File serves immediate, specific purpose
- [ ] Correct directory path selected
- [ ] Not creating for "completeness"
- [ ] Not auto-generating reports/summaries
- [ ] File name follows project conventions

---

## 📝 RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### When User Requests Documentation:
```
"I'll create [specific documentation] in docs/[category]/[filename].md. 
This will include [specific content]. Should I proceed?"
```

### When Uncertain About File Creation:
```
"I can help with [requested action]. Would you like me to create documentation 
for this? If so, what type: report, guide, technical spec, or implementation details?"
```

### When User Doesn't Specify Location:
```
"I'll create [file] in [proposed path] based on our directory structure. 
Is this the correct location, or would you prefer it elsewhere?"
```

## 🚀 QUALITY STANDARDS

### File Creation Standards:
1. **Purposeful** - Every file must solve a specific problem
2. **Requested** - User must explicitly ask for file creation
3. **Located** - Must be in semantically correct directory
4. **Named** - Follow project naming conventions
5. **Documented** - Include header with purpose/scope if applicable

### Code Quality Standards:
1. **Modular** - Follow existing architecture patterns
2. **Consistent** - Match existing code style
3. **Tested** - Include or suggest testing approach
4. **Documented** - Include inline comments for complex logic

## ⚠️ COMMON VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

### Documentation Violations:
❌ Creating summary files without request  
❌ Auto-generating implementation reports  
❌ Creating "complete documentation" unprompted  
❌ Making files "for future reference"  

### Path Violations:
❌ Putting documentation in `src/`  
❌ Putting code in `docs/`  
❌ Creating files in root unnecessarily  
❌ Mixing file types in wrong directories  

### Purpose Violations:
❌ Creating files "just in case"  
❌ Making reports for "completeness"  
❌ Auto-documenting every change  
❌ Creating placeholders for future use

## 🏆 SUCCESS METRICS

A successful interaction:
- ✅ User gets exactly what they requested
- ✅ Files are in correct locations  
- ✅ No unnecessary files created
- ✅ Project structure remains clean
- ✅ Documentation only when explicitly requested

**Remember: LESS IS MORE. Only create what is explicitly requested, and always in the correct location.**
