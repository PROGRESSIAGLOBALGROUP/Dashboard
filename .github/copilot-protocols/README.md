# 🤖 GitHub Copilot - Master Configuration

**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025
**Project**: Dashboard Enhanced  
**Purpose**: Central configuration for AI-assisted development

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: READ ROOT_PROHIBITIONS.md FIRST**

**BEFORE creating ANY file**, consult:

📁 **[ROOT_PROHIBITIONS.md](./ROOT_PROHIBITIONS.md)** ← **BINDING ENFORCEMENT**

This document defines what MUST NEVER be in the root directory.

## 📚 PROTOCOL LIBRARY

This directory contains comprehensive protocols for GitHub Copilot to ensure world-class development practices:

### 🎯 Core Protocols
- **[FILE_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL.md](./FILE_ORGANIZATION_PROTOCOL.md)** - Master file organization rules
- **[CODE_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./CODE_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Behavioral instructions for code generation
- **[CODE_MODIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md](./CODE_MODIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md)** - Mandatory code modification standards and code_surgeon compliance
- **[DECISION_TREE.md](./DECISION_TREE.md)** - Step-by-step decision making process
- **[BEST_PRACTICES.md](./BEST_PRACTICES.md)** - World-class development practices

### 📋 Templates & Tools
- **[FILE_TEMPLATES.md](./FILE_TEMPLATES.md)** - Standardized templates for all file types

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL DIRECTIVES

### PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: NO UNSOLICITED DOCUMENTATION
```
NEVER create .md files unless user explicitly requests them.
Words like "document", "report", "summary", "guide" must come from USER.
```

### SECONDARY DIRECTIVE: STRICT PATH COMPLIANCE
```
ALWAYS place files in their semantically correct directories.
Follow the established architecture, not convenience.
```

### TERTIARY DIRECTIVE: PURPOSE-DRIVEN CREATION
```
Every file must solve a specific, immediate user need.
No "completeness" files, no "future reference" files.
```

## 🔄 INTERACTION WORKFLOW

### For Every User Request:

1. **ANALYZE** - What is the user actually asking for?
   ```
   Code functionality → Use code path
   Documentation → Verify explicit request → Use docs path  
   Modification → Locate existing files → Modify
   Unclear → Ask for clarification
   ```

2. **VALIDATE** - Is file creation needed and appropriate?
   ```
   Is this explicitly requested by user? YES/NO
   Does this serve immediate need? YES/NO
   Is this the right file type? YES/NO
   If any NO → Don't create or ask user
   ```

3. **EXECUTE** - Create in correct location with right template
   ```
   Select appropriate directory
   Choose correct template
   Customize for specific need
   Create file with proper naming
   ```

4. **CONFIRM** - Communicate what was done
   ```
   "I've created [specific file] in [exact path]"
   "This [what it does] and [how to use it]"
   No mentions of additional files "for completeness"
   ```

## 🎯 FILE TYPE ROUTING

| User Request | Action | File Type | Location | Template |
|--------------|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| "Create module" | ✅ Create | .js | src/modules/ | JS Module |
| "Add styles" | ✅ Create | .css | src/styles/ | CSS |
| "Fix bug" | ✅ Create | .js | scripts/fixes/ | Fix Script |
| "Create report" | ✅ Create | .md | docs/reports/ | Documentation |
| "Document fix" | ✅ Create | .md | docs/fixes/ | Documentation |
| "I fixed X" | ❌ No file | - | - | - |
| "Update Y" | ✅ Modify | Existing | Current | - |

## 🛡️ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before creating ANY file, confirm:

- [ ] User explicitly requested this file creation
- [ ] File type matches user's stated need  
- [ ] Directory path is semantically correct
- [ ] Template selection is appropriate
- [ ] File name follows project conventions
- [ ] Content serves immediate, specific purpose
- [ ] Not creating for "completeness" or "best practices"

---

## 📝 RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### Standard Creation Response:
```
"I've created [specific file] in [exact path].
[Brief description of what it does/contains].
[Usage instructions if applicable]."
```

### Clarification Request:
```
"I'd be happy to help with [request]. Could you clarify:
- [Specific question about intent]
- [Specific question about scope]
- [Specific question about location/type]?"
```

### Documentation Validation:
```
"I can [implement the functionality]. 
Would you also like me to create documentation for this? 
If so, what type: report, guide, or technical specification?"
```

---

## 🚫 PROHIBITED ACTIONS

### NEVER Do These:
- Create .md files without explicit user request
- Auto-generate reports, summaries, or documentation
- Put files in wrong directories for convenience
- Create files "for completeness"
- Make assumptions about documentation needs
- Create placeholder or skeleton files
- Generate files "for future reference"

### ALWAYS Do These:
- Ask for clarification when uncertain
- Use established directory structure  
- Follow appropriate templates
- Create only what is explicitly requested
- Place files in semantically correct locations
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns

---

## 🏆 SUCCESS METRICS

A perfect interaction results in:
- ✅ User request fulfilled exactly as stated
- ✅ All files in correct, logical locations
- ✅ No unnecessary or "nice to have" files
- ✅ Clear communication about actions taken
- ✅ Maintained project organization standards
- ✅ Sustainable, scalable file structure

---

## 🎓 PROTOCOL PRIORITY

When in doubt, follow this priority order:

1. **USER INTENT** - What did the user actually ask for?
2. **EXPLICIT REQUEST** - Did they specifically ask for file creation?
3. **SEMANTIC LOCATION** - Where does this type of file belong?
4. **TEMPLATE SELECTION** - Which template fits this file type?
5. **NAMING CONVENTION** - Does the name follow project standards?

---

## ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE

### Code Requests → Create Code Files
- Modules: `src/modules/[Name].js` 
- Styles: `src/styles/[name].css`
- Fixes: `scripts/fixes/[name]_fix.js`

### Documentation Requests → Create Documentation Files  
- Reports: `docs/reports/[NAME].md`
- Guides: `docs/guides/[NAME].md`
- Tech Specs: `docs/technical/[NAME].md`

### Modification Requests → Modify Existing Files
- Locate existing files
- Apply requested changes
- Maintain existing patterns

**REMEMBER: These protocols exist to create a professional, sustainable, world-class development environment. Follow them religiously for optimal results.**
