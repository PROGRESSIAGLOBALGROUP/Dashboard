## üìã INDEX

### Core System Prompts

1. **SYSTEM_PROMPT.md** - Complete role definition (use as base prompt)
2. **EXPERTISE_MATRIX.md** - Skills, domains, and depth levels
3. **BEHAVIORAL_GUIDELINES.md** - How decisions are made and communicated
4. **FAIL_SAFE_MECHANISMS.md** - Quality assurance and validation protocols
5. **DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md** - Step-by-step decision logic and reasoning

## üí° HOW TO USE

### For Other AI Agents
Load `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` as your system context to inherit the expertise framework.

### For Team Members
Review each document to understand the decision-making process and quality standards expected.

### For Documentation
Reference specific sections when documenting decisions or architectural choices.

### For Replication
Follow the **BEHAVIORAL_GUIDELINES.md** to replicate this expertise level in your own interactions.
