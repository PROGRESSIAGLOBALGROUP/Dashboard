## 📋 ALIGNMENT VALIDATION PROCESS

1. **Evaluate SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Does function/class have one reason to change?
   - Open/Closed: Can extend without modifying existing code?
   - Liskov Substitution: Can implementations substitute transparently?
   - Interface Segregation: Clients see only what they need?
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions?

2. **Check DRY Principle**
   - Any code duplicated across files?
   - Any repeated patterns not abstracted?
   - Shared logic properly extracted?
   - Utilities appropriately leveraged?

3. **Verify KISS Principle**
   - Is solution as simple as possible?
   - Any unnecessary abstractions?
   - Any premature optimization?
   - Complexity justified by requirements?

4. **Validate YAGNI Principle**
   - Added features solving current problems?
   - No speculative "might need" features?
   - No "nice to have" additions?
   - Focus on essential requirements?

5. **Assess Architectural Alignment**
   - Follows established patterns?
   - Integrates with existing systems?
   - Scalability maintained?
   - Performance characteristics acceptable?

## 📊 SOLID Principles Detailed

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

❌ **Violation**:
```javascript
class UserManager {
    createUser() { }
    validateEmail() { }
    sendEmail() { }
    saveToDatabase() { }
    generateToken() { }
}
```

✅ **Compliant**:
```javascript
class UserManager {
    createUser() { }
}

class EmailValidator {
    validateEmail() { }
}

class EmailService {
    sendEmail() { }
}

class UserRepository {
    saveToDatabase() { }
}

class TokenGenerator {
    generateToken() { }
}
```

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

❌ **Violation**:
```javascript
if (type === 'admin') { doAdminAction(); }
else if (type === 'user') { doUserAction(); }
else { throw new Error('Unknown type'); }
```

✅ **Compliant**:
```javascript
class UserRole {
    performAction() { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
}

class AdminRole extends UserRole {
    performAction() { doAdminAction(); }
}

class StandardUserRole extends UserRole {
    performAction() { doUserAction(); }
}
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

❌ **Violation**:
```javascript
class Bird {
    fly() { return 'flying'; }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    fly() { throw new Error('Penguins cannot fly'); }
}
```

✅ **Compliant**:
```javascript
class Animal {
    move() { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
}

class FlyingBird extends Animal {
    move() { return 'flying'; }
}

class Penguin extends Animal {
    move() { return 'swimming'; }
}
```

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

❌ **Violation**:
```javascript
interface Worker {
    work();
    eat();
    sleep();
    manage();
}
```

✅ **Compliant**:
```javascript
interface Workable {
    work();
}

interface Eatable {
    eat();
}

interface Sleepable {
    sleep();
}

interface Manageable {
    manage();
}
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

❌ **Violation**:
```javascript
class UserService {
    constructor() {
        this.database = new MySQLDatabase();
    }
}
```

✅ **Compliant**:
```javascript
class UserService {
    constructor(database) {
        this.database = database;
    }
}
```

## 🎓 Alignment Quality Examples

### ❌ MISALIGNED Work:

```
Issue: Added new calculation method directly to UIController
Problems:
- Violates SRP: UIController handles logic, not UI
- Creates duplication: Logic in wrong place
- Over-complex: Should be in DataProcessor
- Architectural violation: Pattern mismatch
```

### ✅ ALIGNED Work:

```
Solution: Added calculation to DataProcessor
Compliance:
- SRP: DataProcessor owns calculations ✓
- DRY: Reuses existing pattern ✓
- KISS: Maintains simplicity ✓
- YAGNI: Only adds required feature ✓
- Architecture: Follows existing pattern ✓
```
