# 🚪 GATE 1: Understanding Gate

**Purpose**: Verify that the problem is crystal clear before proceeding  
**Blocking Criteria**: Vague problem, multiple interpretations, unclear scope  
**Output Required**: Clear problem statement with defined success criteria

## 🎯 Your Mission

Ensure that when work is proposed, the problem is **completely understood**:
- ✅ Problem clearly stated
- ✅ All terms defined
- ✅ Scope boundaries explicit
- ✅ Success criteria measurable
- ✅ No ambiguity remains

---

## 🚫 BLOCKING CRITERIA (Must All Be Satisfied)

❌ **BLOCK if**:
1. Problem statement is vague or unclear
2. Multiple interpretations possible
3. Success criteria undefined
4. Scope not bounded
5. Key terms not defined
6. Ambiguous wording remains

---

## ✅ PASSING CRITERIA (All Must Be True)

✅ **PASS if**:
1. Problem is stated in ONE clear sentence
2. All key terms are defined
3. Scope boundaries are explicit (what IS included, what IS NOT)
4. Success criteria are measurable
5. No ambiguity in the statement
6. Stakeholders agree on understanding

## 📋 UNDERSTANDING VALIDATION PROCESS

1. **Extract Problem Statement**
   - What is the user trying to solve?
   - Single clear sentence?
   - Or multiple/conflicting problems?

2. **Validate Scope**
   - What IS included?
   - What IS NOT included?
   - Clear boundaries?

3. **Validate Success Criteria**
   - How will we know it's solved?
   - Measurable or subjective?
   - Clear and specific?

4. **Check for Ambiguity**
   - Any terms that could mean multiple things?
   - Any unclear pronouns or references?
   - Any implicit assumptions?

5. **Confirm Understanding**
   - Can it be restated in clear terms?
   - Would others understand the same way?
   - Is there consensus?

## 🎓 Understanding Quality Examples

### ❌ UNCLEAR Problem:

```
"Fix the dashboard"

Problems:
- What's broken?
- What should it do?
- Scope is undefined
- Success criteria unknown
```

### ✅ CLEAR Problem:

```
"The admin panel modal closes unexpectedly when clicking 
the weight factor tooltip. Users lose unsaved changes.

We need to: Prevent the modal from closing when tooltip is visible,
so users can reference weight factors without losing work.

Success: Modal stays open, tooltip displays, no data loss."

Scope: Admin panel modal only, weight factor tooltip interaction
Excludes: Other tooltips, other modals, CSS styling
```
