## 📋 GOVERNANCE VALIDATION PROCESS

1. **Verify Organization Compliance**
   - Files in correct directories?
   - Naming conventions followed?
   - Structure consistent with standards?
   - Documentation in right locations?

2. **Check Code Modification Compliance**
   - dist/ changes via code_surgeon?
   - Proper parsing with context?
   - Validation gates used?
   - Rollback capability confirmed?

3. **Validate Variable Initialization**
   - Declaration phase proper?
   - Initialization phase correct?
   - Usage phase valid?
   - Cleanup phase present?

4. **Verify Testing Compliance**
   - Coverage requirements met?
   - Test types included?
   - Edge cases covered?
   - Error scenarios tested?

5. **Assess Documentation Compliance**
   - Only created when requested?
   - Correct type and location?
   - Complete and accurate?
   - Properly maintained?
