## 📋 QUALITY VALIDATION PROCESS

1. **Assess Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests written for all functions?
   - Integration tests verify workflows?
   - Edge cases covered?
   - Error scenarios tested?
   - Target: ≥ 80% coverage

2. **Evaluate Code Quality**
   - Single Responsibility Principle: Each function has one job?
   - Open/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification?
   - Liskov Substitution: Derived code substitutable for base?
   - Interface Segregation: Client-specific interfaces?
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions?

3. **Check for Code Smells**
   - Duplication: Same code in multiple places?
   - Complexity: Function too complex (>10 decisions)?
   - Long functions: > 20 lines?
   - Magic numbers: Undefined constants?
   - Poor naming: Functions/variables unclear?

4. **Validate Performance**
   - Meets response time requirements?
   - Memory usage acceptable?
   - Caching strategies appropriate?
   - Database queries optimized?
   - No N+1 queries?

5. **Verify Error Handling**
   - Input validation comprehensive?
   - Error messages clear and actionable?
   - Graceful degradation implemented?
   - All edge cases handled?
   - Recovery mechanisms available?
