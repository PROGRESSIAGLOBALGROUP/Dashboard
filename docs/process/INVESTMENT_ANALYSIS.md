## 5. RISK-ADJUSTED ANALYSIS

### Cost Overrun Scenarios

**Conservative Estimate (20% overrun):**
```
Total Cost: $89,700 × 1.20 = $107,640
Year 2 ROI: (85,000 - 13,700) ÷ 107,640 = 66% ✅
Still profitable by Year 2
```

**Pessimistic Estimate (35% overrun):**
```
Total Cost: $89,700 × 1.35 = $121,095
Year 2 ROI: (85,000 - 13,700) ÷ 121,095 = 59% ✅
Still profitable by Year 2
```

**Worst Case (50% overrun + 20% benefit reduction):**
```
Total Cost: $89,700 × 1.50 = $134,550
Annual Benefit: $85,000 × 0.80 = $68,000
Year 2 ROI: (68,000 - 13,700) ÷ 134,550 = 40% ⚠️
Break-even still achieved by Q2 2026
```
