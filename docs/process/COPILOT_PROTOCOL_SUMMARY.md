## 🎯 Protocol Enforcement Rules (NOW IN EFFECT)

### ✅ ALWAYS
```
✅ Identify file type BEFORE creation
✅ Determine correct destination folder
✅ Create file in final location immediately
✅ Verify file is in correct folder post-creation
✅ Update references to new location
✅ Use 'chore: organize' commit message
✅ Never leave files in root to "clean up later"
```

### ❌ NEVER
```
❌ Create .js, .md, .ps1 files in root
❌ Create temporary files in root
❌ Assume markdown belongs in root
❌ Leave helper scripts scattered in root
❌ Create new folders at root level
```

---

## 📁 Root Directory Structure (AFTER)

```
✅ README.md
✅ package.json
✅ dashboard_enhanced.html
✅ index.html
✅ .github/
✅ src/
✅ dist/
✅ docs/
✅ data/
✅ scripts/
✅ tests/
✅ code_surgeon/
✅ surgery/

❌ NO orphaned .md files
❌ NO orphaned .js scripts
❌ NO orphaned .ps1 scripts
✅ CLEAN & ORGANIZED
```
