# üìå SPRINT 0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - FINAL CORRECTED VERSION

**Status**: Corrected & Simplified  
**Key Change**: 100% client-side architecture recognized  
**Impact**: 50% effort reduction (14h ‚Üí 6-8h)  
**Date**: October 24, 2025

## üéØ THE CORRECTION

### What We Realized
Dashboard is **100% client-side** with **NO server required**.

### What This Means
- ‚úÖ Just open HTML in browser = Application works
- ‚úÖ No node server, no ports, no servers
- ‚úÖ Works completely offline
- ‚úÖ Data stored in browser's localStorage
- ‚úÖ Data shared via JSON import/export

### Effort Impact
```
Original Plan:    14 hours (with server assumptions)
Corrected Plan:   6-8 hours (client-side only)
Reduction:        50% less work! ‚úÖ
```
