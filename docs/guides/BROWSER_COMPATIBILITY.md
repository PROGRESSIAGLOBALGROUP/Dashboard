## 🔧 Critical Requirements

The Dashboard requires **3 key browser features**:

### 1. ES6 JavaScript Support ✅

**What it is**: Modern JavaScript (2015 standard)

**Required for**:
- Arrow functions `() => {}`
- Template literals `` `string` ``
- Classes `class Dashboard {}`
- Destructuring `const {x, y} = obj`
- const/let instead of var

**Browser Support**: All modern browsers support this.

**If feature is missing**:
```
❌ Dashboard won't work
✅ All supported browsers have this
```

### 2. localStorage API ✅

**What it is**: Browser storage for persistent data

**How we use it**:
```javascript
// Save data between sessions
localStorage['dashboard_config_v1'] = JSON.stringify(config);

// Load data on page open
const config = JSON.parse(localStorage['dashboard_config_v1']);
```

**Storage Limits**:
- Chrome/Edge: ~10 MB
- Firefox: ~10 MB
- Safari: ~5 MB
- Mobile: ~5 MB

**Our Usage**: ~1-2 KB for typical config (well under limits)

**Browser Support**: All modern browsers support this.

**If feature is missing**:
```
❌ Dashboard will load but changes won't persist
✅ All supported browsers have this
```

### 3. Fetch API (Optional but Recommended) ✅

**What it is**: Modern way to make HTTP requests

**How we might use it**:
```javascript
// Potential future feature: import from URL
fetch('https://example.com/config.json')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => loadConfig(data));
```

**Current Status**: Not used in v1.2.0 (all offline)

**Browser Support**: All modern browsers support this.

**Fallback**: XMLHttpRequest available in all browsers if needed.

## 🔍 Common Browser Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "localStorage is not available"

**Symptoms**:
- Data doesn't persist after refresh
- Console error: `ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined`

**Possible Causes**:
1. Private/Incognito browsing mode (some browsers block localStorage)
2. Browser storage disabled
3. Third-party cookies blocked (rare)

**Solutions**:
```
1. Try in normal (non-private) browsing mode
2. Check browser settings for localStorage
3. Disable extensions that block storage
4. Try different browser
```

### Issue: "JavaScript console shows errors"

**Symptoms**:
- Red errors in console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
- Dashboard doesn't work as expected

**Debug Steps**:
```
1. Open console (F12 / Cmd+Option+I)
2. Look for error messages
3. Note the error exactly
4. Check:
   - Does it happen on page load?
   - Does it happen on specific action?
   - Which browser/version?
5. Report to team with screenshot
```

**Common Errors & Fixes**:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Unexpected token` | JSON parse error | Verify JSON export is valid |
| `Cannot read property` | Null/undefined reference | Refresh page, try again |
| `StorageManager is not defined` | Module load issue | Rebuild: `python build/...` |
| `CORS policy` | Cross-origin request | This shouldn't happen (all local) |

### Issue: "Responsive design looks broken"

**Symptoms**:
- Layout broken on mobile
- Text too small/large
- Buttons not clickable

**Debug Steps**:
```
1. Check browser zoom level
   - Ctrl+0 to reset (Cmd+0 on Mac)
2. Check if mobile zoom enabled
   - Should auto-adjust
3. Try different browser
4. Check viewport width (F12 → Device toolbar)
```

**Device Widths**:
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Tablet: 768-1024px
- Mobile: <768px

### Issue: "Export/Import not working"

**Symptoms**:
- Export button doesn't download
- Import doesn't accept files
- Files selected but nothing happens

**Debug Steps**:
```
1. Try different file (not corrupted)
2. Verify JSON is valid (use online JSON validator)
3. Check file size (should be < 500KB)
4. Try different browser
5. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
```

### Issue: "Changes don't persist after refresh"

**Symptoms**:
- Make changes, refresh page
- All changes are gone

**Root Cause**: localStorage not available

**Solutions**:
```
1. Exit private/incognito mode
2. Check storage is allowed:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Cookies allowed
   - Firefox: Preferences → Privacy → Cookies allowed
   - Safari: Settings → Privacy → Cookies allowed
3. Disable storage-blocking extensions
```

## 🚀 Performance by Browser

### Load Time

| Browser | Time | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Chrome** | 100-200ms | Fastest, optimized |
| **Edge** | 100-200ms | Chromium, similar to Chrome |
| **Firefox** | 150-250ms | Slightly slower |
| **Safari** | 150-250ms | Varies by device |

**Factors That Affect Performance**:
- Computer speed (older devices slower)
- Number of apps in data (more = slightly slower)
- Browser extensions (can slow down)
- First load vs subsequent (cached is faster)
