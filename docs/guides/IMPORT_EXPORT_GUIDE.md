### **Export**
Creating a backup file of your Dashboard data in JSON format.

**What gets exported:**
- All Business Units (BUs)
- All Applications
- All Waves
- All progress calculations
- All settings

**What does NOT get exported:**
- Browser history
- Your laptop settings
- External files

**Format**: Plain text JSON file (.json)

### **Import**
Loading a previously exported JSON file back into Dashboard.

**What happens:**
1. File is read
2. Data is validated
3. **REPLACES** current Dashboard data (destructive!)
4. Dashboard refreshes with new data
5. Data saved to browser storage

---

## üíæ Why Use Import/Export?

### **Scenario 1: Backup Your Work**
```
Problem: "I made lots of changes, don't want to lose them"
Solution: Export once per week
  ‚Üí Save to OneDrive/Google Drive
  ‚Üí Have backup if browser storage is cleared
```

### **Scenario 2: Share Data with Team**
```
Problem: "Need to share current status with the team"
Solution: Export from your machine
  1. Export JSON file
  2. Email or upload to shared drive
  3. Team member imports same file
  4. Everyone sees same data

Result: Team stays in sync!
```

### **Scenario 3: Move to Different Computer**
```
Problem: "I'm getting a new laptop"
Solution: Export/Import approach
  1. On old laptop: Export JSON
  2. Save to USB/email/cloud
  3. On new laptop: Import JSON
  4. All data restored instantly
```

### **Scenario 4: Start Fresh**
```
Problem: "Current data is corrupted, want to reset"
Solution: Import good backup
  1. You have old backup from last week
  2. Import that backup
  3. Bad data is replaced
  4. Back to last week's state
```

### **Scenario 5: Team Merge**
```
Problem: "Two teams have separate dashboards, need to merge"
Solution: Manual merge process
  1. Export from Team A dashboard
  2. Import into Team B dashboard
  3. Manually reconcile conflicts
  4. Export merged result
  5. Share with everyone
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **IMPORT IS DESTRUCTIVE**
```
When you import:
  ‚úó Current data is DELETED
  ‚úó New data replaces it
  ‚úó Cannot undo! (unless you have backup)

Always backup before importing!
```

### **File Must Be Valid JSON**
```
Valid JSON looks like:
  {
    "buses": [...],
    "apps": [...],
    "waves": [...]
  }

Invalid JSON will:
  ‚úó Show error message
  ‚úó Not import
  ‚úó Keep current data safe
```

### **Browser Storage Limits**
```
Each browser has limit: ~10 MB per site
Dashboard typically uses: 50-500 KB
Unless you have:
  - 1000+ applications
  - Very large datasets
  You're fine!
```

### **One Dashboard Per Browser Tab**
```
If you have 2 tabs open:
  Tab 1: Dashboard with data X
  Tab 2: Dashboard with data Y
  
Warning: Whichever tab imports last wins!
  ‚Üí Data from other tab gets overwritten

Solution: Only use 1 tab at a time
```

## üìä JSON File Structure

### **What's Inside the Export File**

```json
{
  "exportDate": "2025-10-24T15:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "buses": [
    {
      "buId": "CORF",

    }
  ],
  "apps": [
    {
      "APP_ID": "APP001",
      "name": "Authentication System",
      "buId": "CORF",
      "status": "WIP",
      "progress": 75,
      "weight": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "waves": [
    {
      "waveId": "WAVE1",
      "name": "Wave 1",
      "target_date": "2025-12-31"
    }

## üîê Security Considerations

### **What You're Exporting**
```
‚úì Your data (Business Units, Apps, Waves)
‚úì Progress calculations
‚úì Project information
‚úó NO passwords
‚úó NO secrets
‚úó NO credentials
```

### **Data Privacy**
```
When exporting:
  ‚úì Data stays on YOUR computer
  ‚úì Nothing sent to servers (client-side app!)
  ‚úì 100% offline process
  ‚úì No cloud upload
  ‚úì You control the file
```

### **Safe Practices**
```
‚úì Export regularly (weekly)
‚úì Store in secure location (OneDrive, etc)
‚úì Don't share JSON files publicly
‚úì Verify file before importing
‚úì Keep backups in multiple locations
```

### **Risky Practices**
```
‚úó Sharing JSON files publicly
‚úó Storing on unsecured USB
‚úó Emailing without encryption
‚úó Saving to shared network drives (if sensitive)
‚úó Not verifying file before import
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Import/Export

### **Issue: Export Button Doesn't Work**

**Symptom:**
- Click Export, nothing happens
- No file downloads

**Solution:**
```
1. Check pop-up blocker
   ‚Üí Allow downloads from localhost/file
   
2. Check browser download settings
   ‚Üí Should ask where to save (or auto-save)
   
3. Try different browser
   ‚Üí Chrome ‚Üí Firefox
   ‚Üí Firefox ‚Üí Edge
   ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Safari

4. Clear cache and try again
   Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   ‚Üí Clear cookies & cache
   ‚Üí Refresh page
   ‚Üí Try export again
```

### **Issue: Import Button Doesn't Work**

**Symptom:**
- Click Import, file picker doesn't open
- File picker opens but crashes

**Solution:**
```
1. Check file is actual .json
   ‚Üí Rename if needed: export.txt ‚Üí export.json
   
2. Check file size is reasonable
   ‚Üí Should be < 1 MB
   ‚Üí If > 5 MB, file might be corrupted
   
3. Try opening file in text editor first
   ‚Üí Make sure it contains valid JSON
   ‚Üí Go to jsonlint.com and validate
   
4. Clear localStorage and try again
   ‚Üí F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage
   ‚Üí Delete "dashboard_config_v1"
   ‚Üí Refresh and try import
```

### **Issue: Import Says "Invalid Format"**

**Symptom:**
- Click Import, select file
- Error: "Invalid JSON format"

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: File is corrupted**
```
Check: Open file in text editor
Look for: Starting with { and ending with }
Should not have: Incomplete lines, odd characters

Fix: Export fresh copy from working Dashboard
```

**Cause 2: File is wrong type**
```
Check: File extension is .json
Try: Renaming file to .json

Fix: Export fresh from Dashboard (always .json)
```

**Cause 3: File is from old Dashboard version**
```
Check: Look inside file for "version" field
Should show: "1.2.0" or close

Fix: Re-export from current Dashboard version
```

### **Issue: Import Works But Data Looks Wrong**

**Symptom:**
- Import succeeds, but:
  - Some applications missing
  - Progress calculations wrong
  - Business Units not showing

**Solution:**
```
1. Verify file contents
   ‚Üí Open in text editor
   ‚Üí Check structure looks correct
   
2. Verify in browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
   ‚Üí Type: Dashboard.StorageManager.getCurrentConfig()
   ‚Üí Press Enter
   ‚Üí Check what loaded

3. Try re-exporting fresh copy
   ‚Üí Import that fresh copy
   ‚Üí See if same issue appears

4. Check for partial data
   ‚Üí Only some BUs imported? 
   ‚Üí File might have been cut off
   ‚Üí Re-export full file
```

## üöÄ Advanced: Programmatic Access

### **For Developers Only**

**Access Current Configuration (DevTools Console):**
```javascript
// Get current data
const config = Dashboard.StorageManager.getCurrentConfig();
console.log(config);

// Get specific BU
const bu = config.buses.find(b => b.buId === 'CORF');
console.log(bu);

// Get all applications
console.log(config.apps);

// Export to console
JSON.stringify(config, null, 2);
```

**Import Programmatically (DevTools Console):**
```javascript
// If you have JSON data in variable
const newConfig = {
  buses: [...],
  apps: [...],
  waves: [...]
};

// Save to storage
Dashboard.StorageManager.saveConfig(newConfig);

// Refresh UI
Dashboard.UIController.apply();
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

**Before Sharing JSON File:**

```
‚ñ° File opens in text editor
‚ñ° Starts with: {
‚ñ° Ends with: }
‚ñ° Contains "buses" array
‚ñ° Contains "apps" array
‚ñ° Contains "waves" array
‚ñ° File size reasonable (< 1 MB)
‚ñ° No error messages in browser console
‚ñ° Data matches what you see in Dashboard
```

**Before Importing JSON File:**

```
‚ñ° File has .json extension
‚ñ° File opens in text editor (valid format)
‚ñ° Validated at jsonlint.com (optional)
‚ñ° File size < 1 MB
‚ñ° You have current backup (export first!)
‚ñ° File from trusted source
‚ñ° Checked with team lead if needed
```

## üéì Understanding the Data Format

### **Why JSON?**
```
‚úì Human readable (can open in text editor)
‚úì Universal format (works everywhere)
‚úì Supported by all browsers
‚úì Easy to share and backup
‚úì Standard for data exchange
```

### **Can I Edit the JSON File?**
```
Technically: Yes, you can edit in text editor
Practically: Not recommended unless you know JSON

What can go wrong:
  ‚úó Syntax errors (missing commas, quotes)
  ‚úó Corrupted data (unbalanced braces)
  ‚úó Invalid values (wrong status, negative progress)
  ‚úó Structural issues (missing required fields)

Better: Use Dashboard admin panel to make changes
```

### **What If I Have Multiple Dashboards?**
```
Dashboard 1 (My Laptop):
  ‚Üí Export: dashboard1.json
  
Dashboard 2 (Team Server):
  ‚Üí Export: dashboard2.json

To Sync:
  1. Manually merge files (or ask tech lead)
  2. Import merged version to both
  3. Everyone now has same data

To Keep Separate:
  - Don't import between them
  - Each maintains own export backups
```
