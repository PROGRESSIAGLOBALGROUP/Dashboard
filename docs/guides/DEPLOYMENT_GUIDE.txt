📋 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

STEP 1: Verify Files Exist
Location: c:\PROYECTOS\Dashboard\surgery\

Confirm these files exist:
□ fragments/applications_overview_world_class.html
□ patches/applications_overview_world_class.css
□ patches/applications_overview_world_class.js
□ jobs/applications_overview_world_class_upgrade.json

STEP 2: Review Job File
File: surgery/jobs/applications_overview_world_class_upgrade.json

Contains:
✓ 3 sequential patches
✓ HTML replacement
✓ CSS injection
✓ JavaScript injection
✓ Validation checks
✓ Rollback configuration

STEP 3: Execute via code_surgeon
The job file handles all deployment tasks:
• Locates target sections in dist/dashboard_enhanced.html
• Creates automatic backup
• Applies all three patches
• Validates each step
• Enables automatic rollback if needed

STEP 4: Verification
After deployment:
1. Open dashboard_enhanced.html in browser
2. Navigate to Admin → Applications Overview
3. Verify visual appearance matches design
4. Test all filters (search, status pills, wave)
5. Check responsive layout at different sizes
6. Confirm no console errors in DevTools
7. Verify other tabs are unaffected

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚙️ CONFIGURATION & CUSTOMIZATION

Color Scheme:
The upgrade uses CSS variables from your theme:
• --primary: #5b9dff (action elements)
• --ok: #32e685 (complete status)
• --warn: #ffd166 (in progress status)
• --danger: #ff5f7a (at risk/to start status)
• --text: #e9eef7 (text color)
• --panel: #0e1627 (background)
• --ring: #1a2a48 (borders)

These can be adjusted by modifying CSS variables without touching code.

Metrics Calculation:
Metrics are calculated in real-time from filtered data:
• Total: Count of all applications
• Completion: Average progress % (excluding 0 values)
• At Risk: Count of apps with progress < 50%
• Wave Distribution: Count by wave

All calculations use data from Dashboard.StorageManager.

Responsive Breakpoints:
Three layout configurations:
• Desktop: 1200px+ (4-column KPI grid, full features)
• Tablet: 768-1199px (2-column KPI grid, optimized)
• Mobile: < 768px (1-column KPI grid, stacked controls)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔐 SCOPE & ISOLATION

MODIFIED:
✓ Applications Overview tab ONLY

PRESERVED:
✓ Business Units tab (UNCHANGED)
✓ Applications tab (UNCHANGED)
✓ Whitelabel Configuration (UNCHANGED)
✓ Calculation Formulas (UNCHANGED)
✓ Settings tab (UNCHANGED)
✓ All core dashboard logic (UNCHANGED)
✓ Storage system (UNCHANGED)
✓ Admin functionality (UNCHANGED)

NO BREAKING CHANGES:
