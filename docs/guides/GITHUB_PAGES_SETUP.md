• Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
• Pull request checks

Actions:
✓ Checkout code
✓ Setup GitHub Pages
✓ Build documentation index
✓ Copy assets (docs/, dashboard files)
✓ Upload to artifact
✓ Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

### 2. **Documentation Structure** ✅
```
docs/
├── guides/                  ← User guides & tutorials
├── technical/               ← Technical specifications
├── implementations/         ← Implementation details
├── features/                ← Feature documentation
├── fixes/                   ← Troubleshooting
├── process/                 ← Process & audit documentation
├── releases/                ← Release notes

```

### 3. **Documentation Hub** ✅
```
Files Created:
• index_hub.md             ← Main navigation hub
• .github/workflows/pages.yml ← Auto-deployment

Accessible at:
• Local: index_hub.md (or README.md for project overview)
• GitHub Pages: https://PROGRESSIAGLOBALGROUP.github.io/Dashboard/
```

### 4. **Root Directory Cleanup** ✅
```
Before:  21 files (cluttered)
After:   5 files (clean & organized)

Kept:
✓ README.md                 ← Project documentation
✓ package.json              ← Dependencies
✓ dashboard_enhanced.html   ← Main application
✓ index.html                ← Landing page
✓ create_redirect.bat       ← Utility script

Moved to docs/:
→ All audit files → docs/process/audits/
→ All guides → docs/guides/
→ All technical → docs/technical/
→ All features → docs/features/
→ All fixes → docs/fixes/
```

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS TO ACTIVATE GITHUB PAGES

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/PROGRESSIAGLOBALGROUP/Dashboard/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select: main branch
3. Select folder: / (root) or /docs (if you want docs-only)
4. Click "Save"
```

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Runs
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/PROGRESSIAGLOBALGROUP/Dashboard/actions
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow

4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
```

### Step 3: Access Your Site
```
Once deployed, visit:
https://PROGRESSIAGLOBALGROUP.github.io/Dashboard/

OR with custom domain (if configured):
https://your-custom-domain.com
```

## 🛠️ CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

### If You Want to Change Deployment Source:
```
Edit .github/workflows/pages.yml:
Line ~60: path: '_site'  ← Change to your folder

Examples:
path: '_site'           ← Build output
path: 'docs'            ← Docs folder only
path: '.'               ← Root directory
```

### If You Want Custom Domain:
```
1. Buy domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Go to: Settings → Pages → Custom domain
3. Enter your domain
4. DNS configuration shown
5. Wait for verification (green checkmark)
```

### If You Want to Add Build Step:
```
Add step to .github/workflows/pages.yml:
- name: Build Documentation
  run: |
    # Your build commands here
    echo "Building..."
```

## 📊 WORKFLOW STATUS MONITORING

### Check Deployment Status:
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/PROGRESSIAGLOBALGROUP/Dashboard/actions
2. Find: "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click latest run to see details
4. Look for ✅ or ❌ status
```

### If Deployment Fails:
```
1. Check workflow logs (click on failed run)
2. Common issues:
   • Missing file (check path)
   • Syntax error (check YAML)
   • Permission issues (check .github/workflows/ permissions)
3. Fix issue and re-run workflow
```

## 🔐 SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES

✅ **Enabled:**
- GitHub Actions permissions (read contents, write pages)
- Automatic branch protection
- Deployment environment specified
- Concurrency limit (prevents multiple simultaneous deployments)

✅ **Recommendations:**
- Keep main branch protected (require PR reviews)
- Archive old releases to maintain speed
- Monitor workflow runs for failures
- Update dependencies regularly

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Pages not deploying?
→ Check: Settings → Pages → Source is set to "main"

### 404 errors?
→ Check: File paths use forward slashes (/)
→ Check: index.html or index.md exists

### Site looks wrong?
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
→ Clear cache in browser settings

### Workflow failing?
→ Check: Actions tab for error logs
→ Check: YAML syntax (no tabs, use spaces)
