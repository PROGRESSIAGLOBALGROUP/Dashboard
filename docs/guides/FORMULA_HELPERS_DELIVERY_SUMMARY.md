### 4. Decision Matrix (5-Row Guide)

Helps users choose based on their situation:

| Situation | Recommendation | Action |
|-----------|---|---|
| Apps with different priorities | ✨ Weighted Avg | Customize weights per app |
| All apps equal importance | ✨ Simple Avg | Use default weights (1.0) |
| Critical: ALL must complete | ✨ Minimum | Include only CLO status |
| Focus on active work | Any | Include WIP+CLO, exclude TBS |
| Show realistic timeline | Any | Include TBS+WIP+CLO |

**Feature**: "✨ RECOMMENDED" badges with green glow animation

### 5. Parameter Quick Reference (3 Key Parameters)

**📊 Weight (App Importance)**
- Range: 0.3 - 10.0
- Default: 1.0
- Meaning: Lower = less important, 1.0 = standard, higher = more important

**🔥 Criticality (Urgency Multiplier)**
- Range: 0.5 - 2.0
- Default: 1.0 - 1.2
- Applied on top of weight

**🔄 Status Inclusion (TBS/WIP/CLO)**
- Decide which statuses to include
- TBS = Future work (for realistic timeline)
- WIP = Active work (usually include)
- CLO = Finished work (usually include)

**Feature**: Monospace parameter ranges, color-coded, with explanations

---

### 6. Recommended Configuration Box

"Best Practice for Most Organizations":
- **Method**: Weighted Average
- **Status**: Include all (TBS + WIP + CLO)
