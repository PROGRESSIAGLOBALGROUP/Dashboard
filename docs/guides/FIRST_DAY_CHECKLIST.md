  • "Create a new feature"
  • "Write tests for module X"

What to do:
  1. Understand the task
  2. Ask questions if unclear
  3. Check related documentation
  4. See task in project board (if available)
```

**1️⃣3️⃣ Start Working (30 min)**
```
Follow this process:

1. Read the task thoroughly
2. Find relevant code files
3. Understand current behavior
4. Identify what needs changing
5. Make small, focused changes
6. Test your changes locally
7. Run: npm test

## 🎯 Key Concepts To Understand

### **1. 100% Client-Side Application**
```
What this means:
  ✓ Dashboard runs entirely in your browser
  ✓ No backend servers needed
  ✓ Works completely offline
  ✓ Data stored in browser (localStorage)
  ✓ Export/Import for sharing

Why it matters:
  • Simple to develop
  • Easy to deploy
  • No database administration
  • Perfect for small teams
```

### **2. Three-Layer Architecture**
```
Layer 1: UIController
  ✓ Renders the display
  ✓ Handles all DOM manipulation
  ✓ Updates what users see

Layer 2: DataProcessor & AdminPanel
  ✓ Business logic
  ✓ Calculations
  ✓ Admin features

Layer 3: StorageManager
  ✓ Saves data to localStorage
  ✓ Loads data on startup
  ✓ Handles persistence

Flow: Storage → Logic → UI
```

### **3. Progress Calculation**
```
Formula: Σ(progress × weight) / Σ(weight)
For applications where status ≠ 'TBS' (To Be Started)

Example:
  App 1: 80% progress, weight 2.0
  App 2: 50% progress, weight 1.0
  
  Calculation: (80×2 + 50×1) / (2.0+1.0) = 210/3 = 70%
```

### **4. Git & Version Control**
```
Why we use it:
  • Track all changes
  • Multiple people can work together
  • Easy to revert mistakes
  • Clear history of project

What you'll do:
  • git clone (get code)
  • git add (stage changes)
  • git commit (save changes)
  • git push (upload to server)
  • git pull (download latest)
```
