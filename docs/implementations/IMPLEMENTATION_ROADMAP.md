  └─ Run on every commit

Level 2: Integration Testing (QA)
  └─ Feature workflows end-to-end
  └─ Database integration
  └─ API contract testing
  └─ Run daily

Level 3: System Testing (QA)
  └─ Cross-feature interactions
  └─ Performance and load
  └─ Security scanning
  └─ Run before sprint end

Level 4: UAT (Product)
  └─ Real user scenarios
  └─ Business workflow validation
  └─ Sign-off requirement
  └─ Run pre-release

Level 5: Production Monitoring (DevOps)
  └─ Real-time performance
  └─ Error tracking
  └─ User analytics
  └─ Continuous
```

### Success Criteria (Must Meet All)
```

```

### Rollout Gates (Go/No-Go Decision Points)
```
Gate 1: Sprint completion (Friday, week N)
  ├─ All tests passing? → Proceed
  ├─ Coverage ≥80%? → Proceed
  └─ Any CRITICAL bugs? → HOLD

Gate 2: UAT completion (3 days before release)
  ├─ 95%+ UAT pass rate? → Proceed
  ├─ Stakeholder sign-off? → Proceed
  └─ Any HIGH priority issues? → Delay

Gate 3: Pre-production check (1 day before release)
  ├─ All dependencies available? → Proceed
  ├─ Infrastructure ready? → Proceed
  ├─ Monitoring active? → Proceed
  └─ Team on-call? → Proceed
```

## RISK MANAGEMENT & MITIGATION

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Timeline overrun (>2 weeks) | MEDIUM | HIGH | 20% contingency buffer built in |
| Key person unavailable | LOW | HIGH | Cross-training + external contractor on standby |
| Performance degradation | LOW | MEDIUM | Load testing every sprint + benchmarking |
| Scope creep | MEDIUM-HIGH | MEDIUM | Change control process strict, features deferred to Phase 2 |
| Integration issues | LOW | MEDIUM | Integration testing automated, early CI/CD |
| Security vulnerabilities | MEDIUM | HIGH | Security review built into every feature, SAST scanning |

### Escalation Path
```
Dev Issue → Dev Lead (same day) → PM (if blocks sprint)
  ↓
Technical Blocker → Architecture review → Escalate to Tech Director
  ↓
Budget/Timeline Risk → PM → CFO (if impacts business)
  ↓
Go/No-Go Decision → Project Steering Committee (Exec + Product)
```
